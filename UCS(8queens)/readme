The compilation of this code works in the following manner-

1)the code is for the 8queens problem in which we have to set the queen such that all queen are in the safe side
2)so for the input we do not enter as such any value
3)we directly run the program and we get the output of a chessboard representing 1 as the place where queen can be placed
