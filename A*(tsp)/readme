The compilation of code works in the following ways-

1)In the starting I have declared city and is defined as 11 so there are total of 11 nodes,so if you want to change input first change the city node.
2)distance between each node is given as a 2d matrix (11x11) which is also initialize in the main function you can change it accordingly
3)so if you run it then it will show the min cost path with its cost.
